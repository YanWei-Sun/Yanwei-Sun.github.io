Welcome! I am a first-year ((2021 Fall)) PhD student of Operations Research (remote enrollment) at University of Washington (UW), advised by Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html).  Prior to UW, I obtained my undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2021.
