Welcome! I am a first-year (2021 Fall) PhD student of Operations Research (remote enrollment) at University of Washington (UW), Seattle. I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Li Jin](https://jinli.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

Prior to UW, I obtained my undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2021.



My research interest is around mechanism/marketplace design. Recently, I am working on signal-free intersection management and contests design. 



### News

- I am extremely sad to share that because of the [US visa issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043), I have no choice but to quit from UW. I will join in Imperial [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/) this summer to pursue my PhD study in [Analytics & Operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/analytics-operations/).
