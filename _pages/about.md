### About Me

Welcome! I am a first-year (2021 Fall) PhD student of [Operations Research](https://ise.washington.edu/) (remote) at [University of Washington (UW), Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/). I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Li Jin](https://jinli.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/).  Prior to UW, I obtained my undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2021.



My research interest is around **mechanism/market design** and **revenue management**. When analyzing these problems, I am broadly interested in tools from *game theory*, *stochastic process*, *statistics*, and *optimization*. Recently, my research centers around transportation system, and contests design.


### News

<!-- - I am **looking for roommates** for *at least 12 months* if possible in *London* and moving date *in late Aug 2022* (flexible).  You can find my personal information [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1keMFajTmlQNvhl5kCZxcjZSYWe46y67k/view?usp=sharing). If you are also looking for roommates in London, feel free to contact me :) -->

- I am sorry to say that because of the [US visa issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043), I have no choice but to quit from UW. I will join in [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/) this autumn to continue my PhD study in [Analytics & Operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/analytics-operations/).
