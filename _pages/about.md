Welcome! I am a first-year (2021 Fall) PhD student of Operations Research (remote enrollment) at University of Washington (UW), Seattle. I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Li Jin](https://jinli.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

Prior to UW, I obtained my undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2021.
