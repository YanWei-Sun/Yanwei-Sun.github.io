### About Me

Welcome! I am a first-year (2022 Fall) PhD student of [Analytics & Operations](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/analytics-operations/) at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/). Previously, I spent one year working with Prof. [Chiwei Yan](https://yanchiwei.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Li Jin ](https://jinli.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [University of Washington (UW), Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/) as a PhD student (remotely, quit because of the [US visa issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043)). Prior to UW, I obtained my undergraduate degree (with summa cum laude) in Industrial Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My research centers around **mechanism** and **market design**. Recently, I hold a particular interest in problems from online platforms and transportation systems with strategic agents. When analyzing these problems, I am broadly interested in tools from *game theory*, *stochastic process*, *optimization*, and *statistics*.




### News

- Excited to share that my undergraduate work \<*Assessment of Student Learning through Reflection on Doing Using the Latent Dirichlet Algorithm*\> was finally accepted by Journal of Mechanical Design! Thanks so much to all of my collaborators.
